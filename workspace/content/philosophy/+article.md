description: the guiding principles behind Aubade
---

Aubade avoids being rigid or prescriptive. it focuses instead on clarity and composability, letting you shape content structures to your needs rather than bending your work to fit the tool.

## behind the name

Aubade `/ō-ˈbäd/` comes from _Made in Abyss_, where it refers to "Supreme Treasures of the Netherworld", rare artifacts of immense power and versatility. the word itself is French for "dawn serenade", a song at daybreak. together, the two origins suggest both practicality and a certain sense of poetry — qualities Aubade tries to carry into its design.

## own your data

your content should outlive any framework. Aubade treats files as the source of truth, with first-class support for markdown and front matter — formats that keep your content portable and free of lock-in.

## separation of concerns

mixing prose and application logic in the same place quickly becomes unmanageable. by isolating content, projects remain easier to maintain and scale, whether you're working solo or in a team — writers can edit markdown, developers can work on code, and neither side has to step on the other.
