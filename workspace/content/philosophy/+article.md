description: the guiding principles behind Aubade
---

Aubade avoids rigidity and prescription. it focuses on clarity and composability, letting you shape content structures to your needs rather than bending your work to fit the tool.

## behind the name

**Aubade** `/ō-ˈbäd/` appears in _Made in Abyss_ as "Supreme Treasures of the Netherworld" — rare artifacts of immense power and versatility. the word is also French for "dawn serenade", a song at daybreak. together, the two origins suggest both practicality and poetry — qualities Aubade aims to carry into its design.

## own your data

content should outlive any framework. Aubade treats files as the source of truth, with first-class support for markdown and front matter — formats that keep your work portable and free of lock-in.

## separation of concerns

mixing prose and application logic in the same place quickly becomes unmanageable. by isolating content, projects remain easier to maintain and scale: writers can edit markdown, developers can work on code, and neither side has to step on the other.
