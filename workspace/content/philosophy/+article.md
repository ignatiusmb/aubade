Aubade tries to avoid being too rigid and prescriptive, instead it focuses on clarity and composability. this lets you shape content structures to your needs instead of bending your work to fit the tool.

## own your data

your content should outlive any framework. Aubade treats files as the source of truth, with no proprietary formats or lock-in. you can always take your data elsewhere.

## separation of concerns

mixing prose and application logic in the same place quickly becomes unmanageable. by isolating content, projects remain easier to maintain and scale, whether you're working solo or in a team — writers can edit markdown, developers can work on code, and neither side has to step on the other.

## behind the name

Aubade `/ō-ˈbäd/` comes from *Made in Abyss*, where it refers to "Supreme Treasures of the Netherworld", rare artifacts of immense power and versatility. the word itself is French for "dawn serenade", a song at daybreak. the name points to what Aubade aims for: a practical tool built with a sense of form and elegance.
